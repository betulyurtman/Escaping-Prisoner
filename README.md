Hello! :)

This is the code I wrote 2 years ago for my programming lecture.

Here, we are computing the days it takes for prisoner to reach the freedom.
There are 5 doors with different probabilities for selecting.
Each door has a different end. Some takes the prisoner to freedom, some takes the prisoner to a tunnel which ends with going back to the cell.

Thank you for reading this :)
